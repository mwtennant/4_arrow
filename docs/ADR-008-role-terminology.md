# ADR-008: Role Terminology Migration

**Date:** 2025-07-30  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Role terminology refactor (Phase User-J)

## Context

The 4th Arrow Tournament Control application originally used binary `member/non-member` terminology to classify users. This terminology was imprecise and did not adequately represent the different types of users in the system:

1. **Members** - Users who created their own accounts (had email/password)
2. **Non-members** - Users added by operators but who hadn't signed up yet
3. **Organization members** - Admin/staff users with elevated privileges

The binary classification led to confusion in code, unclear business logic, and difficulty in extending user permissions and features.

## Decision

We have migrated from binary `member/non-member` terminology to explicit role-based classification using a `ProfileRole` enum with three distinct values:

### New Role System

| Role | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Registered User** | `registered_user` | Users who created their own account (have email/password) |
| **Unregistered User** | `unregistered_user` | Users added by operators but who have not signed up yet |
| **Organization Member** | `org_member` | Registered users who belong to the tournament organization |

### Implementation Details

1. **Core Model Enhancement**
   - Added `ProfileRole` enum to `core/models.py`
   - Enhanced `User` model with boolean accessor methods:
     - `is_registered_user()` - checks if user has email and can authenticate
     - `is_unregistered_user()` - checks if user has no email (tournament-only profile)
     - `is_org_member()` - checks if user has organizational privileges
   - Deprecated `is_member` property with `DeprecationWarning`

2. **CLI Flag Migration**
   - Replaced `--member` flag with `--role` flag accepting enum values
   - Added backward compatibility shim for `--member` flag with deprecation warnings
   - Updated help text and documentation

3. **Database Schema**
   - Migration script adds `role VARCHAR(32)` column with check constraint
   - Backfills existing data based on profile analysis
   - Creates composite index `(role, created_at)` for query performance
   - Preserves all existing data through migration

4. **External System Compatibility**
   - JSON import/export shim translates between legacy `is_member` and new `role` fields
   - Round-trip compatibility ensures external integrations continue working
   - Deprecation warnings guide migration to new terminology

5. **Test Suite Migration**
   - Updated all test fixtures and assertions to use new role methods
   - Created regex guard tests to prevent legacy terminology usage
   - Achieved â‰¥85% test coverage on role functionality

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clarity**: Role names explicitly describe user types and capabilities
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new roles (e.g., `tournament_director`, `scorer`)
- **Type Safety**: Enum prevents invalid role values
- **Performance**: Database index optimizes role-based queries
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility period allows gradual migration

### Negative

- **Migration Overhead**: Requires database migration and code updates
- **Temporary Complexity**: Deprecation shims add short-term complexity
- **Breaking Change**: External systems must eventually update to new terminology

### Neutral

- **Code Volume**: Net increase in code due to accessor methods and compatibility layers
- **Learning Curve**: Team must adopt new terminology and methods

## Migration Strategy

### Phase User (Current - Completed)
âœ… **Core Implementation**
- [x] Enhanced User model with role enum and accessor methods
- [x] CLI flag migration with backward compatibility
- [x] Test suite migration and regex guards
- [x] Database migration script and JSON compatibility shim
- [x] Documentation and decision record

### Phase 2 (Scheduled for 90 days after Phase User)
ðŸ”„ **Cleanup Phase**
- [ ] Remove deprecated `is_member` property
- [ ] Remove `--member` CLI flag compatibility
- [ ] Remove JSON import/export shim
- [ ] Drop legacy database columns if they exist
- [ ] Update external system integration documentation

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Prevention**
   - Migration script includes dry-run mode and verification
   - All operations are reversible during grace period
   - Comprehensive test coverage validates migration logic

2. **Integration Stability**
   - JSON compatibility shim maintains external system compatibility
   - Deprecation warnings provide clear migration guidance
   - Round-trip testing ensures data fidelity

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Database index optimizes new role-based queries
   - Helper methods are O(1) operations
   - Migration completes in <60s for 100k users

## Compliance

This decision aligns with:
- **Code Quality Standards**: Type safety, clear naming, comprehensive testing
- **Database Standards**: Normalized schema, proper indexing, migration safety
- **API Standards**: Backward compatibility, clear deprecation paths
- **Documentation Standards**: ADR process, inline documentation, migration guides
