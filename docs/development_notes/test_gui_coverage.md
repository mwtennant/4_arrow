# üìã Summary of Coverage

## Core Functions Available in GUI: ‚úÖ 100% (8/8)

- All basic CRUD operations are available
- Authentication system fully implemented
- Basic search and profile management covered

## Advanced Features Missing from GUI: ‚ùå ~30%

- Enhanced List-Users: No role filtering, date filtering, or CSV export
- Advanced Merge: No dry-run preview, no automated resolution modes
- Batch Operations: No multi-user merge capability
- Data Export: No CSV export functionality

## Key GUI Limitations

1. List-Users Enhancement: GUI search is basic - missing role filtering (registered_user, unregistered_user, org_member), date range filtering, and CSV export
2. Merge Sophistication: GUI merge lacks the advanced features like dry-run preview and automatic conflict resolution modes
3. Data Export: No way to export user data to CSV from the GUI
4. Bulk Operations: GUI is designed for single-user operations, not batch processing

## ‚ú® Recommendation

The GUI covers all core functionality well, but would benefit from:

1. Enhanced user filtering with role and date range options
2. CSV export capability for user data
3. Merge preview functionality before execution
4. Batch operation support for administrative tasks

The CLI provides more advanced administrative features while the GUI focuses on user-friendly individual operations.
