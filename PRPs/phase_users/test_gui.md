# Product Requirements Prompt: Test GUI Interface (Phase User-F)

## Summary

Design and implement a minimal, visually clean GUI to support operator testing workflows for the 4th Arrow Tournament Control application. This web interface will serve as the foundation for both developer and production GUIs going forward, providing a fast and clear visual interface for testing users, tournaments, and other entities while establishing layout and component architecture for future production use.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Phase User: Core Web Framework Setup

1. Set up Flask web application with basic structure
2. Configure SQLAlchemy integration with existing `inventory.db`
3. Implement basic routing and template rendering
4. Create base template with navigation structure

### Phase 2: Authentication and Landing Page

1. Implement login/logout functionality using existing auth system
2. Create user authentication routes and forms
3. Build landing page with personalized greeting
4. Handle session management and user state

### Phase 3: Navigation and Layout

1. Design and implement top navigation bar (Users, Organizations, Tournaments, Settings)
2. Create contextual sidebar navigation system
3. Implement responsive layout with clean typography
4. Apply minimalist CSS styling with system fonts

### Phase 4: Core User Management Pages

1. Build user listing page with database integration
2. Create user creation form interface
3. Implement basic profile viewing capabilities
4. Add user management operations (create, view, list)

### Phase 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases

1. Implement graceful error handling for database issues
2. Create fallback content for empty states
3. Add form validation and user feedback
4. Handle authentication failures and session timeouts

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation

1. Write comprehensive test suite for all routes
2. Test form validation and error handling
3. Validate database integration and edge cases
4. Ensure 85% test coverage for all backend logic

## Non-Goals / Future Work

### Phase User Exclusions

- Full user profile editing forms (basic viewing only)
- Scoring interface or tournament management
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Client-side JavaScript logic beyond browser defaults
- Mobile/tablet responsiveness optimization
- Advanced user permissions or role management
- Real-time updates or WebSocket functionality
- Advanced search and filtering beyond basic forms
- File upload capabilities
- Email notifications or external integrations

### Future Enhancements

- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- Advanced user profile management
- Tournament and scoring interfaces
- Mobile-responsive design
- Enhanced search and filtering
- User role management
- Real-time updates
- API endpoints for external integration

## Example Usage Workflow

```
1. Operator visits http://localhost:5000/login
2. Enters credentials → authenticated → redirects to /
3. Sees "Hello John Doe, what are you testing now?" landing page
4. Clicks "Users" in top navigation → sidebar shows context menu
5. Clicks "List Users" → sees table of all users from database
6. Clicks "Add User" → form to create new user
7. Fills form → submits → user created → redirects to user list
8. Clicks user name → views individual user profile
9. Clicks "Logout" → session cleared → redirects to login
```

## Edge Cases

### Database Edge Cases

- No users in database → "No users found" message with "Add User" button
- Database connection failure → global error page with retry option
- Slow database queries → loading states and timeouts
- Database schema changes → graceful degradation

### Authentication Edge Cases

- Invalid login credentials → form validation with clear error messages
- Session timeout → automatic redirect to login with message
- User has no name → fallback to "Hello, User" or "Hello, Tester"
- Multiple failed login attempts → temporary lockout (optional)

### Navigation Edge Cases

- Sidebar context doesn't match current tab → defaults to safe fallback
- Direct URL access to protected routes → redirect to login
- Bookmark navigation to non-existent pages → 404 error handling
- Browser back/forward navigation → proper state management

### Form Edge Cases

- Empty form submissions → validation errors with helpful messages
- Invalid data formats → client and server-side validation
- CSRF token missing → security error with retry option
- Form data too large → appropriate error handling

## Additional Notes

### Development Approach

- Start with basic Flask application structure
- Implement authentication first for security
- Build core pages incrementally
- Add styling and polish last
- Test thoroughly at each phase

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all route handlers
- Integration tests for database operations
- Form validation tests
- Authentication flow tests
- Edge case and error condition tests

### Deployment Considerations

- Development server configuration
- Static file serving
- Database file permissions
- Session secret key management
- Environment-specific configuration

This GUI implementation will serve as a testbed for the real application interface. The focus should be on readability, functionality, and establishing good architectural patterns rather than visual polish. Think "developer tool" rather than "production UI" for this phase.
